# Data Structures Fundamentals

Data structures are the foundation of computer science. They study how to organize and store data in computers to enable efficient access and modification.

## What are Data Structures?

A data structure is a format for organizing, managing, and storing data that makes data access and modification more efficient. Choosing the right data structure is crucial for designing efficient algorithms.

## Main Classifications

### Linear Data Structures

- [Array](/computer-science/data-structures/array) - The most basic data structure
- [Linked List](/computer-science/data-structures/linked-list) - Dynamic data structure
- Stack - Last In First Out (LIFO)
- Queue - First In First Out (FIFO)

### Non-linear Data Structures

- Tree - Hierarchical structure
- Graph - Complex relationship structure
- Hash Table - Fast lookup structure

## Learning Focus

When studying data structures, focus on:

1. **Time Complexity** - Operation efficiency
2. **Space Complexity** - Memory usage
3. **Application Scenarios** - When to use which structure
4. **Implementation Details** - How to code the implementation

## Next Steps

We recommend starting with the most basic array, then gradually moving to more complex data structures. Each structure has its unique advantages and applicable scenarios.
